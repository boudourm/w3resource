### [Java Datatype: Exercise-9](https://www.w3resource.com/java-exercises/datatypes/java-datatype-exercise-9.php)

***
<p>Write a Java program that accepts two integers and then prints the sum, the difference, the product, the average, the distance (the difference between integer), the maximum (the larger of the two integers), the minimum (smaller of the two integers).</p>

***
_Sample output:_
<pre class="output">Input 1st integer: 25                                                                                       
Input 2nd integer: 5                                                                                        
Sum of two integers: 30                                                                                     
Difference of two integers: 20                                                                              
Product of two integers: 125                                                                                
Average of two integers: 15.00                                                                              
Distance of two integers: 20                                                                                
Max integer: 25                                                                                             
Min integer: 5
