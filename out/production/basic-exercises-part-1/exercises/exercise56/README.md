***
<p>Write a Java program to find the number of values in a given range divisible by a given value.<br>

_Sample Data:_

For example x = 5, y=20 and p =3, find the number of integers within the range x..y and that are divisible by p i.e. {
i :x ≤ i ≤ y, i mod p = 0 }
***
_Sample output:_
<pre class="output">
Input the beginning of the range: 5
Input the end of the range: 20
Input the divider : 5
Number of integers divisible by 5 : 4
